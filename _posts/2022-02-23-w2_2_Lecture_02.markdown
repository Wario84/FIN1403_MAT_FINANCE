# Introduction

In lecture one, we had an overview of the set of skills that we need to acquire as Data scientists. But, in addition to these skills, we also need to set our analytical skills and our reason to navigate complex problems. As Data scientists we are regularly facing complexity and our weapons are our set of skills and also a well-ordered use of our reason. Reasoning is a cognitive process that takes sets of information, evidence and principles to revise or generate conclusions [(Johnson-Laird & Byrne, 1993)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475206001198#bib10).  Gathering the skills without a properly ordered mind may be like a powerful construction tool in the hands of an untrained worker.

For our training we have to distinguish between two ways of reasoning, one is inductive and the second one is deductive [Klauer, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475206001198#bib14). According to Klauer, deductive reasoning is a process that departs from a set of general premises to reach a logically valid conclusion. The conclusions from deductive reasoning are implicit because if the first general statement is true, the other claims are then valid. However, in Data Science, Econometrics and Statistics, we typically rely more on inductive reasoning, because:

- We do not observe the population, and typically we work with samples.
- It is not evident what is the relationship between variables $$F(x)=y$$.

You may be wondering how does this be related to Data Science? Well, most of the work in statistics and science uses inductive reasoning. Because inductive reasoning starts with lower-level premises or observations from data to reach a general conclusion or an overall rule. In fact, I'm almost sure that inductive reasoning is not new for you. Perhaps you are only becoming aware that you use this kind of reasoning more often than you may have thought. Because inductive reasoning involves finding regularities, differences, patterns and relations among variables to arrive at a more general conclusion [(Neubert and Binko, 1992)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475206001198#bib21). We perform this activity all the time in our daily life when we make decisions with little information under uncertainty. But also, inductive reasoning as the natural way of deriving scientific principles [(Polya, 1967)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475206001198#bib23). Indeed, we use inductive reasoning more often than you may be aware.

> > - Inductive reasoning corresponds to probabilistic, uncertain, approximate reasoning, and as such, it corresponds to everyday reasoning;
> > - Induction itself is a way of reasoning uncertain events and thus is used by children and adults; 
> > - Is central to several cognitive activities, including categorization, similarity judgment, probability judgment, and decision making.
> > - Induction is traditionally contrasted with deduction; It is sometimes said that induction goes from the specific to the general, and deduction goes from the general to the specific.
> > - For example, after observing that many individual dogs bark, one might induce a more general belief that all dogs bark.
> > -  Alternately, having a general belief that all dogs bark, one might deduce that some particular dog will bark.




Inductive reasoning is the default reasoning that we use in Data science and statistics because follows the scientific method. We start acquiring a set of observations or data for testing and conducting analysis to derive higher-level principles or predictions. But we should distinguish between inductive reasoning as a creative process of the mind, and inductive inference, a more rigid mathematical or statistical procedure [(Hassad, (2020)](https://www.iase-web.org/ojs/SERJ/article/view/133/41). This distinction is important, because, as Hassad, pointed out, even if Data Science and Machine learning methods use well-defined induction processes they do not reduce the need for human reasoning. In other words, they depend on the mind of the Data Scientist that will deploy and interpret these novel methodologies.

# Knowledge Discovery From a Database as a problem of induction


# A framework of Inductive Reasoning

The research of [Klauer, (1988, ](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5171693) [1992, ](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0937445920030205), [1999)](http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/11927/1/CsBeno_Teaching_1999.pdf#page=132), defines inductive reasoning as *the systematic and analytic comparison of objects aiming at discovering similarities and/or differences between attributes or relations*. According to his work, most inductive problems can be broken down to six classes: generalization, discrimination, cross-classification,
recognizing relationships, differentiating relationships and system construction). Relations, as in the kind of bonds between objects, if we are familiar with statistics, we may think about the relationship between $$X$$ on $$Y$$. But, it may be also the relationship between two individuals; friendship, partnership or kindship. The second class refers to the attritutes of the object, for instance, if a geometric figure is a triangle, or if a fruit is an apple, or if a person has certain nationality. 





The framework of Klauer was simplified by [Christou and Papageorgiou (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959475206001198), who proposed to approach the process of inductive reasoning distinguishing between three main countructs: *similarity, dissimilarity and integration*.







To understand better some specific ways in which we use inductive reasoning, let's navigate some specific examples using the framework of  for teaching inductive reasoning:
